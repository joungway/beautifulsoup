# Description

I use BeautifulSoup, a scraping library, to scrape data from the National Parks website. For each state, I scrape data representing all National Sites, with its name, its type, its location value and its description.

- This is Wei Zhang.
- The project I choose is option 1.
- First run this code in terminal, and then it would generate the data in a csv file.
- This project implements caching for all of your data so you don't make too many requests to the site
- This project uses try and except to reasonably handle errors.
